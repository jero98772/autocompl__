# autocompl__

An R-way Trie implementation for autocomplete functionality in JavaScript.

## Installation and Setup

To run the application locally, use one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Using Python HTTP Server
```bash
python -m http.server
```

### Option 2: Using PHP Built-in Server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Once the server is running, open the following URLs in your browser to access different versions of the project:

## Why I Built This

This project is part of a challenge to improve my skills by building multiple projects and experimenting with various techniques while creating useful tools. Through this project, I explored the implementation of autocomplete functionality using efficient data structures like the R-way Trie.
